## Overview

You are more than welcome to contribute code to the project.

If you find an issue with the project, or have a feature suggestion, you can open an issue on Github.

If you want help fixing issues or adding features, you can create a pull request on Github. The new code should ensure 100% unit test coverage, and try to adapt to ObjC as much as possible. Otherwise the pull request will not be accepted.

The project is still in the early stage, and will build more dependency injection capabilities such as files and databases in the future, continue to expand the DSL syntax, and develop extensions for the system framework to simplify iOS. etc. If you want to deeply participate in the development of the project, you can contact us to join the core contribution team and explore the future together.
