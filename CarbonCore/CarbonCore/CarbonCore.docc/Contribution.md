# Contribution

Contribute code to the project.

## Overview

If you find an issue with the project, or have a feature suggestion, you can open an issue on Github.

You are more than welcome to contribute code to the project. You can contribute by fixing bugs or adding new features. For larger code changes, we first recommend discussing them in our Github issues. When submitting a pull request, please ensure 100% unit test coverage of new code and try to adapt to ObjC as much as possible.

> Unit Tests
> 1. Open Carbon.xcworkspace with Xcode
> 2. Execute Command + U under CarbonCore and CarbonObjC Scheme respectively

The project administrator will merge the stable-state feature branch into develop at the appropriate time, delete the feature branch and create a new release branch besed on develop. Projects that need early access to new features can always use the code from the release branch. After a release is done on at least one project, the release branch will merge back into develop and main branch, and the new version will be released on the main branch.
